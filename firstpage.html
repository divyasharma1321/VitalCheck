    <h1>VITAL CHECK</h1>
    <p>The cost of healthcare has been on the rise in this day and age, and your health has been the most valuable asset
        you own. Eating healthy and having a good sleep schedule is effective for preventing illness, but as people get
        busier, it has become more difficult to maintain your health. That is why it is essential for people to take
        dietary supplements. But how do people know what the best supplements are for them? They can ask a doctor, but
        the doctor might miss some information and excluding procedures or tests, you will have to pay an average of
        ₹800-₹1700 across the U.S for a doctor's visit.

        That is why we are introducing Vital Check, an AI powered recommender for dietary supplements.</p>
